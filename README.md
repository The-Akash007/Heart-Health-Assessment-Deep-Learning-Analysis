# Enhanced Heart Health Assessment via Mechatronics Device with Echocardiography images using Deep Learning and based on Ejection Fraction Analysis
First, scikit-image and OpenCV are used for image preprocessing on the echocardiogram pictures in order to eliminate noise and improve contrast. Next, semantic segmentation precisely identifies the borders of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart by utilizing U-net with TensorFlow. This multi-step procedure guarantees accurate LV identification and segmentation, which is essential for further research, like the use of Simpson's biplane approach to calculate ejection fraction.The left ventricle's ejection fraction evaluates heart function and helps with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy choices, especially when managing heart failure and cardiovascular disease.


Raspbian Pi is used in the gadget for automation, apart from image processing and segmentation. It coordinates the gathering, processing, and presentation of data, improving productivity and user engagement. In addition, the device's casing is made of unique parts made possible by 3D printing technology, which guarantees longevity and exact fit. This Raspberry Pi and 3D printing combination highlights progress in software and hardware and results in a complete solution for improved heart health assessment.


This project aims to develop a mechatronics device that leverages deep learning techniques to analyze echocardiography images for assessing heart health. The primary focus is on calculating the Ejection Fraction (EF), a critical parameter indicating the heart's pumping efficiency. Accurate assessment of EF aids in the early detection and management of various cardiac conditions.​
